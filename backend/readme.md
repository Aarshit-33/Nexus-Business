# Nexus: Cloud Accounting Platform - Back-End

The back-end for Nexus, a cloud-based accounting platform, providing the server-side logic for managing employees, customers, vendor bills, expenses, invoices, and sales details.

## Overview

The Nexus back-end is designed to handle the server-side operations of the Nexus Cloud Accounting Platform. It provides a RESTful API for interacting with the data related to employees, customers, vendor bills, expenses, invoices, and sales. The back-end is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database.

## Features

- **Employee Management API:** Endpoints for CRUD operations on employee data.
- **Customer Management API:** Endpoints for managing customer profiles and transactions.
- **Vendor Bills API:** Endpoints for tracking and managing vendor bills.
- **Expense Tracking API:** Endpoints for recording and categorizing expenses.
- **Invoices API:** Endpoints for generating and managing invoices.
- **Sales Tracking API:** Endpoints for monitoring sales and payment receipts.
- **Authentication:** Secure endpoints with JWT-based authentication.

## Installation

To set up the back-end project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/nexux.git
   cd nexus/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add your environment variables. Here is a sample `.env` file:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   DATABASE=your_mongo_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
